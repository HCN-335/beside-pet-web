name: discipline-draft
description: Turn a described discipline problem into a registered entry in polydeukes.config — a judged entry when the declaration grammar and observed evidence can express it, a draft entry otherwise. Use when the user describes a recurring problem they want promised away ("I keep...", "stop X from happening", "we should never...", "how do I enforce Y").

# discipline-draft — from a problem description to a registered discipline

This project is judged by Polydeukes. A discipline starts as prose and climbs a ladder —
`draft` (registered, read, never judged) → `advise` (judged, recorded, never stops a call) →
`block` (stops the call; the user's explicit choice, never the default). This skill walks a
problem description down to the right first rung and registers it.

## Procedure

### 1. Restate the problem as a promise

Rewrite the description as one sentence of the form "X must not happen" or "when A happens,
B must also happen". If the sentence needs "unless" more than once, split it into two
promises and classify each separately.

### 2. Classify the shape

Choose from the current catalogue, then check whether the intended surface can supply the
required evidence. A mechanism name constrains the declaration; it does not implement the
promise by itself. The extracted axes and body relations must be subsets of the admitted
sets below. Scope filtering is separate from the extracted axes.

| Mechanism | Admitted axes | Body relations | Evidence or structural condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pairing` | `world` | `equal` | Compare supplied files or channels; extract keys when values may differ. |
| `companion` | `change`, `world` | `implies` | Compare presence by key; a multi-file promise needs the observed change set. |
| `monotonic-order` | `change`, `world` | `ordered` | Extract a sequence with an explicit comparison field; order is not presence. |
| `fingerprint-sync` | `world` | `equal` | Compare supplied stamps; no generator or compiler runs during judgment. |
| `producer-owned` | `actor` | `empty`, `nonEmpty` | Requires host-provided actor evidence, not an artifact's self-reported producer. |
| `self-absolution-ban` | `change` | `unchanged`, `empty` | Extract protected fields or path changes; choose creation/deletion supply explicitly. |
| `actor-scope` | `actor` | `empty`, `nonEmpty` | Requires a proven actor; a missing actor is not proof of the main session. |
| `precedent` | `history`, `world` | `nonEmpty` | Requires an observed earlier call in a transcript or supplied channel. |
| `phase-order` | `history` | `ordered` | Compare observed call ordinals; missing phases need a separate presence promise. |
| `turn-locality` | `history` | `nonEmpty` | Requires observed turns and time or ordinal boundaries. |
| `stated-ground` | `history` | `nonEmpty` | Can require recorded text, not establish whether its reasoning is sound. |
| `controlled-vocabulary` | `change`, `world` | `subset` | Extract values and an explicit allowed set. |
| `naming` | `change` | `empty`, `nonEmpty` | Scope must read `target.path`; match the intended name pattern. |
| `added-only` | `change` | `empty` | Compare pre/post extractions and judge only newly added matches. |
| `one-way-marker` | `change` | `subset` | Existing markers must remain in the extracted post-change set. |
| `delegated-scope` | — | — | Reserved for a definition-time evaluator; not accepted in current declarations. |
| `scoped-valve` | `change`, `actor`, `world`, `history` | `empty`, `nonEmpty`, `equal`, `subset`, `implies`, `ordered`, `unchanged` | Requires a `witness` block expressing the exception condition. |
| `forbidden-command` | `change` | `empty` | Scope must read `command`; a text pattern is not shell semantic analysis. |

These four requests illustrate the classification boundary:

| Request | Classification | Proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The English and Korean locale files must carry identical keys. | `pairing`, with two supplied files. | An unmatched key breaks; translated values may differ. |
| Every status must belong to an allowed list. | `controlled-vocabulary`, with a supplied allowed set. | An unknown status breaks; an allowed status passes. |
| A successful package lookup must precede a manifest edit. | `precedent`, with observed session history. | Failed or absent lookups break; an unavailable transcript is a supply case. |
| A fresh benchmark must execute during judgment to prove a performance claim. | `draft`: the engine does not execute benchmarks. | Comparing an existing report would be a different promise. |

Run `pdks docs show write-disciplines` for the key-pairing walkthrough and
`pdks docs show configuration --section disciplines` for the declaration grammar.
Use `--lang ko` for Korean; these commands read the installed version offline.

An `added-only` declaration forgives existing occurrences — only what the edit adds breaks
the promise. That is usually what you want: a discipline adopted today should not indict
yesterday's code.

One path-shaped promise takes no `disciplines:` entry at all: a path nobody may touch
belongs in the top-level `protectedPaths:` list — its own config block, never an entry key.

### 3. Check the observation boundary

Do not confuse an expressible relation with available evidence:

- **Files outside the repository** — file-change protection observes the project root.
  Use the host's permission policy for comprehensive protection outside it. A command-text
  pattern may recognize a particular string, but does not observe all resulting writes.
- **Writes by child processes** — arbitrary writes inside a test runner or script are not
  individually observed by the session surface. A commit comparison can observe the resulting
  files when they enter its selected diff; it does not recover the originating tool history.
- **Missing history or actor channels** — choose the declaration's supply policy explicitly.
  Commit observations have no session transcript; `supply: pass` records a skip, not success.
- **Fresh execution or semantic proof** — the engine compares supplied evidence. It does not
  run a new benchmark or prove that a written explanation is true. Preserve that unmet promise
  as a draft rather than silently replacing it with a weaker text check.

### 4a. Expressible now — register a judged entry

Add the entry to the `disciplines:` array in `polydeukes.config.yaml`. Advise is the default
landing — a break is recorded as `advised` and the call goes on — and the `enforce: advise`
line below only spells that default out. NEVER write `enforce: block` from this skill:
promotion to block is the user's own choice, made after the advise measurements have been
read.

The examples below are whole documents, so `languages:` — the schema's one required block —
appears alongside the entry; in a config that already has one, copy the entry only.

```yaml
languages:
  placeholder:
    productionGlob: 'src/**'
    testCmd: 'echo "set a verification command for {scope}"'
disciplines:
  - id: 'no-focused-tests'
    why: 'a committed .only silently shrinks the suite to one test'
    declare:
      mechanism: 'added-only'
      scope: { source: 'target.path', include: ['^src/'] }
      supply: { pre: 'empty', post: 'empty' }
      extract:
        before:
          - { op: 'source', of: 'pre' }
          - { op: 'lines' }
          - { op: 'keyByPattern', re: '(\.only\()' }
        after:
          - { op: 'source', of: 'post' }
          - { op: 'lines' }
          - { op: 'keyByPattern', re: '(\.only\()' }
        added:
          - { op: 'onlyIn', of: 'after', notIn: 'before' }
      relate:
        - id: 'nothing-added'
          relation: { op: 'empty', of: 'added' }
          message: 'adds {key}: {value}'
    enforce: advise
```

A command-line ban reads the fixed source `command` and scopes on it — the scope is part of
the mechanism's shape, so a `forbidden-command` entry without it is refused at load time:

```yaml
languages:
  placeholder:
    productionGlob: 'src/**'
    testCmd: 'echo "set a verification command for {scope}"'
sessionDisciplines:
  - id: 'no-force-push'
    why: 'a force push rewrites history nobody reviewed'
    declare:
      mechanism: 'forbidden-command'
      scope: { source: 'command' }
      extract:
        hits:
          - { op: 'source', of: 'command' }
          - { op: 'lines' }
          - { op: 'matches', re: 'git push\b.*--force(?![\w-])' }
      relate:
        - { id: 'no-force', relation: { op: 'empty', of: 'hits' }, message: '{value}' }
    enforce: advise
```

The following examples implement the first three classification cases. Both locale files and
the allowed-status file must exist and contain valid JSON. File bindings use the proposed
contents for a file changed by the current observation, not a second stale disk read.

```yaml
languages:
  json:
    productionGlob: 'locales/**/*.json'
    testCmd: 'pnpm test'
disciplines:
  - id: 'locale-key-parity'
    why: 'the ko and en locales must carry the same keys'
    declare:
      mechanism: 'pairing'
      scope: { source: 'target.path', include: ['^locales/(ko|en)[.]json$'] }
      sources:
        ko: { file: 'locales/ko.json' }
        en: { file: 'locales/en.json' }
      supply: { ko: 'error', en: 'error' }
      extract:
        koKeys: [{ op: 'source', of: 'ko' }, { op: 'json' }, { op: 'flattenKeys' }]
        enKeys: [{ op: 'source', of: 'en' }, { op: 'json' }, { op: 'flattenKeys' }]
      relate:
        - id: 'parity'
          relation: { op: 'equal', of: ['koKeys', 'enKeys'] }
          messageBySide:
            left: '{key} is in ko only'
            right: '{key} is in en only'
    enforce: advise
```

```yaml
languages:
  json:
    productionGlob: '*.json'
    testCmd: 'pnpm test'
disciplines:
  - id: 'status-vocabulary'
    why: 'statuses.json may contain only values listed in allowed-statuses.json'
    declare:
      mechanism: 'controlled-vocabulary'
      scope: { source: 'target.path', include: ['^statuses[.]json$'] }
      sources: { allowed: { file: 'allowed-statuses.json' } }
      supply: { post: 'error', allowed: 'error' }
      extract:
        selected: [{ op: 'source', of: 'post' }, { op: 'json' }, { op: 'items' }]
        permitted: [{ op: 'source', of: 'allowed' }, { op: 'json' }, { op: 'items' }]
      relate:
        - id: 'allowed-status'
          relation: { op: 'subset', of: 'selected', in: 'permitted' }
          message: 'unknown status: {value}'
    enforce: advise
```

Here both status files are JSON arrays of strings. This declaration scopes on statuses.json;
editing only the allowed list does not trigger it. Broaden the observation deliberately if
changes to that list must recheck all dependent files.

```yaml
languages:
  typescript:
    productionGlob: 'src/**'
    testCmd: 'pnpm test'
sessionDisciplines:
  - id: 'manifest-needs-npm-view'
    why: 'a successful package lookup must precede a manifest edit'
    declare:
      mechanism: 'precedent'
      scope: { source: 'target.path', include: ['^(packages/[^/]+/)?package[.]json$'] }
      sources: { session: { transcript: true } }
      supply: { session: 'pass' }
      extract:
        npmView:
          - { op: 'source', of: 'session' }
          - { op: 'toolUses', names: ['Bash'] }
          - { op: 'filter', when: [{ field: 'succeeded', eq: true }] }
          - { op: 'select', path: 'args.command' }
          - { op: 'matches', re: '^npm view ' }
      relate:
        - id: 'npm-view'
          relation: { op: 'nonEmpty', of: 'npmView' }
          message: 'no successful npm view precedes this edit'
    enforce: advise
```

The precedent example proves only that an observed successful Bash call starts with npm view;
it does not prove that the lookup concerns the dependency being edited. The change-set surface has
no transcript and therefore skips this example by its explicit supply policy.

**Write the regex yourself — the user states the promise, you author the pattern.** The
pattern is the part users find hardest, so never hand the prose back and ask for one. Three
authoring traps, each measured on a live config:

- **A pattern answers a syntactic question only.** "Is this string a forbidden word" is
  syntax; "is this a new dependency version" is meaning, and a regex leaks both ways on a
  semantic question. When the question is semantic, narrow the declaration's own `scope`
  block to the files where any match IS a break, or accept "editing this file at all" as
  the trigger.
- **`^` means what the preceding step left.** After a `lines` step a declaration's
  pattern sees one line at a time, so `^` anchors to that line; over an unsplit source it
  anchors to the whole text and matches the first line only. A ban over the command line
  puts `lines` before its `matches` for exactly that reason.
- **Author both directions.** Before registering, write down one string the pattern must
  match and one nearby string it must not (`only(` vs `only_helper(`, a flag vs its
  substring). A pattern checked in only the breaking direction over-fires in review-proof
  ways.

### 4b. Not expressible yet — register a draft

A draft is prose with a handle: `id`, `why`, and the literal marker `draft: true` — no other
keys. It produces no judgment and no telemetry; `pdks explain` lists it as unpromoted.
Record the intended promise and the exact missing capability inside `why`. Do not classify
pairing, vocabulary, or history promises as drafts merely because they are absent from a short
example list. Check the catalogue, extraction steps, and observation channel first. A reserved
`delegated-scope` declaration cannot be registered as a judged entry.

```yaml
languages:
  placeholder:
    productionGlob: 'src/**'
    testCmd: 'echo "set a verification command for {scope}"'
disciplines:
  - id: 'benchmark-supports-performance-claim'
    why: 'a performance claim needs a fresh benchmark run during judgment; the engine cannot execute it'
    draft: true
```

### 5. Prove it fires, then close

Run `pdks explain` and confirm the new entry is listed (a judged entry with its mechanism
and surfaces; a draft as unpromoted).

For a judged entry, registration is not the finish — a pattern that never fires protects
nothing while looking installed. Fire it once for real, with the proof run the declaration's
own mechanism can actually reach:

| Mechanism | Break it once | The entry's id shows up in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a file-reading one (`added-only`, `naming`, …) | one scratch edit matching the must-match direction | `pdks covenant check --diff` output over `git diff HEAD` on stdin — the exit stays 0 at advise, the id is the proof |
| `forbidden-command` | run one harmless command matching the pattern | the telemetry log tail — at advise the call proceeds and its row records the id |
| `precedent` | one in-scope edit made without the required precedent | the telemetry log tail — a declaration reading the session judges on the session surface only (the change-set surface has none, so its `supply` policy records it `skipped`) |

Then undo the scratch break, repeat the same observation, and confirm a passing row for the
must-NOT-match case. Silence alone may mean a scope miss, unchanged files, or unavailable evidence;
check `pdks explain` and telemetry for `config-fault`, `no-observation`, or `supply-pass`. Close by telling the user which rung the entry landed on and
that `enforce: block` is theirs to add later if the advise record earns it.

## Updating this skill without losing local edits

An upgrade does not overwrite an existing skill; rerunning `pdks-claude-code init` reports it
skipped. Generate a fresh copy in a disposable project using the installed package, compare it
with this file, and merge the changes you want. Keep a backup of local additions. Do not delete
the existing skill to force regeneration in the working project.

## Reading the advise record

An `advised` row means a promise was broken and the call went through anyway. Rows land in
the telemetry log at the path configured by `telemetry.logPath` (default
`.polydeukes/roi.log`). The hook's stderr note is not shown to you, so consult the log at
task boundaries: before committing, or after a batch of edits, read the tail and act on any
`advised` row — fix the break, or tell the user why it should stand. An advisory nobody
reads measures nothing.
